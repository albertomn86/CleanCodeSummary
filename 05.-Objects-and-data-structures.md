# Objects and data structures

## Data abstraction
Hiding implementation is not just to put a layer of functions between the variables, is about abstractions. A class does not simply push its variables out through getters and setters. Rather it exposes abstract interfaces that allow its users to manipulate the essence of the data, without having to know its implementation.

## Data/object anti-symmetry
This exposes the fundamental dichotomy between objects and data structures:
_Procedural code (code using data structures) makes it easy to add new functions without changing the existing data structures. OO code, on the other hand, makes it easy to add new classes without changing existing functions._
So, the things that are hard for OO are easy for procedures, and the things that are hard for procedures are easy for OO.

## The Law of Demeter
The Law of Demeter says that a module should not know about the innards of the objects it manipulates. An object should not expose its internal structure through accessors because to do so is to expose, rather than to hide, its internal structure.

### Train wrecks
Chains of calls like this are generally considered to be sloppy style and should be avoided.
This kind of code is often called a train wreck because it look like a bunch of coupled train cars.
```C#
final String outputDir = ctxt.options.scratchDir.absolutePath;
```
The last line must be replaced by:
```C#
Options opts = ctxt.getOptions();
File scratchDir = opts.getScratchDir();
final String outputDir = scratchDir.getAbsolutePath();
```

### Hybrids
Hybrid structures that are half object and half data structure. They make it hard to add new functions but also make it hard to add new data structures. They are the worst of both worlds. Avoid creating them.

### Hiding structure
Objects are supposed to hide their internal structure, we should not be able to navigate through them.
```C#
String outFile = outputDir + "/" + className.replace('.', '/') + ".class";
FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(outFile);
BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fout);
```
A better approach could be:
```C#
BufferedOutputStream bos = ctxt.createScratchFileStream(classFileName);
```

## Data Transfer Objects
A DTO is a class with public variables and no functions. They are very useful structures, especially when communicating with databases or parsing messages from sockets, and so on.

### Active records
Active Records are special forms of DTOs. They are data structures with public variables, but they typically have navigational methods like _save_ and _find_.
