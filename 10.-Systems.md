# Systems

## Separate constructing a system from using it
_Software systems should separate the startup process, when the application objects are constructed and the dependencies are “wired” together, from the runtime logic that takes over after startup._
This is the LAZY INITIALIZATION/EVALUATION idiom, and it has several merits. We don’t incur the overhead of construction unless we actually use the object, and our startup times can be faster as a result. We also ensure that null is never returned.

### Separation of main
The main function builds the objects necessary for the system, then passes them to the application, which simply uses them.

### Factories
We can use the ABSTRACT FACTORY pattern to give the application control of when to build the object, but keep the details of that construction separate from the application code.

### Dependency injection
Mechanism for separating construction from use. Using DI the class takes no direct steps to resolve its dependencies; it is completely passive. Instead, it provides setter methods or constructor arguments (or both) that are used to inject the dependencies.

## Scaling up
Architectures can grow incrementally, if we maintain the proper separation of concerns.

## Test Drive the System Architecture
An optimal system architecture consists of modularized domains of concern. This architecture can be test-driven, just like the code.

## Optimize decision making
Modularized concerns allows us to make optimal, just-in-time decisions, based on the most recent knowledge

## Use standards wisely, when they add demonstrable value
Avoid become obsessed with strongly hyped standards and do not lose focus on implementing value for customers.

## Systems need Domain-Specific Languages
DSLs raise the abstraction level above code idioms and design patterns. They allow the developer to reveal the intent of the code at the appropriate level of abstraction.
