# Error handling

## Use exceptions rather than return codes
It's better to throw an exception when you encounter an error. The calling code is cleaner.

## Write your try-catch-finally statement first
It's good practice to start with a _try-catch-finally_ statement when you are writing code that could throw exceptions. This helps you define what the user of that code should expect, no matter what goes wrong with the code that is executed in the _try_.

## Use unchecked exceptions
Checked exceptions can sometimes be useful if you are writing a critical library, but in general application development the dependency costs outweigh the benefits.

## Provide context with exceptions
Create informative error messages and pass them along with your exceptions.

## Define exception classes in terms of a caller’s needs
Often a single exception class is fine for a particular area of code and use different classes only if there are times when you want to catch one exception and allow the other one to pass through.

## Define the normal flow
You create a class or configure an object so that it handles a special case for you. When you do, the client code doesn't have to deal with exceptional behavior. That behavior is encapsulated in the special case object. This is called the SPECIAL CASE PATTERN.

## Don’t return Null
Avoiding this minimize the chance of _NullPointerExceptions_ and the code will be cleaner. For example, if we are working with lists, is better to return an empty new list rather than null.

## Don’t pass Null
Returning null from methods is bad, but passing null into methods is worse. Unless you are working with an API which expects you to pass null, you should avoid passing null in your code whenever possible.
