# Comments

## Comments do not make up for bad code
One of the more common motivations for writing comments is bad code.
Clear and expressive code with few comments is far superior to cluttered and complex code with lots of comments.

## Explain yourself in code
Explain most of your intent in code. In many cases it’s simply a matter of creating a function that says the same thing as the comment you want to write.

## Good comments
- Legal comments
- Informative comments
- Explanation of intent
- Clarification
- Warning of consequences
- TODO comments
- Amplification
- Javadocs in Public APIs

## Bad comments
- Mumbling
- Redundant comments
- Misleading comments
- Mandated comments
- Journal comments
- Noise comments
- Scary Noise
- Don’t use a comment when you can use a function or a variable
- Position markers
- Closing brace comments
- Attributions and bylines
- Commented-out code
- HTML comments
- Nonlocal information
- Too much information
- Inobvious connection
- Function headers
- Javadocs in nonpublic code
