# Boundaries

## Using third-party code
A good approach to use third-party code is to wrap this code with our own classes or methods.

## Exploring and learning boundaries
Instead of experimenting and trying out the new stuff in our production code, we could write some tests to explore our understanding of the third-party code.

## Learning tests are better than free
Learning tests verify that the third-party packages we are using work the way we expect them to.

## Using code that does not yet exist
To keep from being blocked, we defined our own interface. One good thing about writing the interface we wish we had is that itâ€™s under our control. This helps keep client code more readable and focused on what it is trying to accomplish.
