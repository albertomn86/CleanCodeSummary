# Formatting

## Vertical formatting
Small files are usually easier to understand than large files are.

### Vertical openness between concepts
Each line represents an expression or a clause, and each group of lines represents a complete thought. Those thoughts should be separated from each other with blank lines.

### Vertical density
If openness separates concepts, then vertical density implies close association. So lines of code that are tightly related should appear vertically dense.

### Vertical distance
Concepts that are closely related should be kept vertically close to each other.
Closely related concepts should not be separated into different files unless you have a very good reason.

- **Variable declarations.** Variables should be declared as close to their usage as possi- ble. Because our functions are very short, local variables should appear a the top of each function

- **Instance variables.** They should be declared at the top of the class.

- **Dependent functions.** If one function calls another, they should be vertically close, and the caller should be above the callee.

- **Conceptual affinity.** Affinity might be caused because a group of functions perform a similar operation. The stronger that affinity, the less vertical distance there should be between them.

### Vertical ordering
A function that is called should be below a function that does the calling.

## Horizontal formatting

### Horizontal openness and density
We use horizontal white space to associate things that are strongly related and disassociate things that are more weakly related.
Another use for white space is to accentuate the precedence of operators.

### Indentation
A source file is a hierarchy rather like an outline. To make this hierarchy of scopes visible, we indent the lines of source code in proportion to their position in the hiearchy.
