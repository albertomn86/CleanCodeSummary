# Unit tests

## The three laws of TDD
- **First Law:** You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.
- **Second Law:** You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.
- **Third Law:** You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.


## Keeping tests clean
Test code is not a second-class citizen. It requires thought, design, and care. It must be kept as clean as production code.

## Clean tests
Readability is perhaps even more important in unit tests than it is in production code. Anyone who reads these tests should be able to work out what they do very quickly, without being misled or overwhelmed by details.

## One assert per test
There is a school of thought that says that every test function in a test should have one and only one assert statement. But a better rule is that we want to test a single concept in each test function. So, the number of asserts could be more than one if we test a single concept.

## F.I.R.S.T.
- **Fast** Tests should be fast and should run quickly.
- **Independent** Tests should not depend on each other.
- **Repeatable** Tests should be repeatable in any environment: local, production, QA.
- **Self-Validating** The tests should have a boolean output. Either they pass or fail.
- **Timely** The tests need to be written in a timely fashion. Unit tests should be written just before the production code that makes them pass. If you write tests after the production code, then you may find the production code to be hard to test.
