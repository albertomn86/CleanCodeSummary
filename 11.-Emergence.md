# Emergence

## Getting clean via emergent design
Kent Beck’s four rules of simple design:
1. Runs all the tests.
2. Contains no duplication.
3. Expresses the intent of the programmer.
4. Minimizes the number of classes and methods.

## Simple Design Rule 1: Runs all the tests
A system that is comprehensively tested and passes all of its tests all of the time is a testable system.

## Simple Design Rules 2–4: Refactoring
Once we have tests, we are empowered to keep our code and classes clean. We do this by incrementally refactoring the code.

## No duplication
Creating a clean system requires the will to eliminate duplication, even in just a few lines of code.

## Expressive
Code should clearly express the intent of its author. The clearer the author can make the code, the less time others will have to spend understanding it.

## Minimal classes and methods
Our goal is to keep our overall system small while we are also keeping our functions and classes small.
