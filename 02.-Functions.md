# Functions

## Small!
The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that.
Functions should not be 100 lines long. Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long.

### Blocks and indenting
This implies that the blocks within if statements, else statements, while statements, and so on should be one line long. Probably that line should be a function call.

## Do one thing
FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING. THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL. THEY SHOULD DO IT ONLY.

## One level of abstraction per function
In order to make sure our functions are doing one thing, we need to make sure that the statements within our function are all at the same level of abstraction. Mixing levels of abstraction within a function is always confusing.

### Reading code from top to bottom
Every function must be followed by those at the next level of abstraction so that we can read the program, descending one level of abstraction at a time as we read down the list of functions.

## Switch statements
They can be tolerated if they appear only once, are used to create polymorphic objects, and are hidden behind an inheritance relationship so that the rest of the system can’t see them. Otherwise, we need to use the abstract factory.

## Use descriptive names
Choosing descriptive names will clarify the design of the module.

## Function arguments
The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero (niladic). Next comes one (monadic), followed closely by two (dyadic). Three arguments (triadic) should be avoided where possible. More than three (polyadic) requires very special justification and shouldn’t be used anyway.
Do not use flag arguments.

## Have no side effects
Function must do one thing and never should do other hidden things.

## Command query separation
Functions should either do something or answer something, but not both.

## Prefer exceptions to returning error codes
Returning error codes from command functions is a subtle violation of command query separation.

## Don’t repeat yourself
The duplication is a problem because it bloats the code.
