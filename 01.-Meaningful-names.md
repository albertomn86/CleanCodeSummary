# Meaningful names

## Use intention-revealing names
Names should reveal intent. The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent.

For example, this variable is used for saving the elapsed time in days:
```C#
int days;
```
Instead of this name, we can use a more descriptive name such as:
```C#
int elapsedTimeInDays;
```

## Avoid disinformation
We should avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning.
For example, if we find a varible called `deviceList`, we expect the variable contents a list.
Beware of using names which vary in small ways.

## Make meaningful distinctions
Do not use the same name to refer to two different things in the same scope. For example, if we need to copy an object we could use the following function:
```C#
public void copyData(object a, object b)
{
    ...
```

The objects names are not distinctives. A better option should be:
```C#
public void copyData(object source, object destination)
{
    ...
```

## Use pronounceable names
If you can't pronounce it, don't use it. For example, instead of `vldcpy`, use `validCopy`.

## Use searchable names
Single-letter names and numeric constants have a particular problem in that they are not easy to locate across a body of text.

```C#
while(n < 32)
{
    ...
```
We can replace it with:
```C#
while(number < MAX_NUMBER)
{
    ...
```

## Avoid encodings
Encoded names are seldom pronounceable and are easy to mis-type.

### Hungarian notation
In modern languages the compilers remember and enforce the types, so we don't need to specify it in the variable name.

### Member prefixes
Adding prefixes to names is not necessary.

### Interfaces and implementations
These are sometimes a special case for encodings. We use the letter `I` to indicate the interface. For example, `IController` is the interface implementation of `Controller`.

## Avoid mental mapping
Readers shouldn’t have to mentally translate our names into other names they already know. This is a problem with single-letter variable names.

## Class names
Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase names like Customer, Device, Account, and AddressParser. Avoid words like Manager, Processor, Data, or Info in the name of a class. A class name should not be a verb.

## Method names
Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like postPayment, getPage, or saveName.

## Don't be cute
Don't use the name `whack()` to mean `kill()`. Don't tell little culture-dependent jokes like `eatMyShorts()` to mean `abort()`.
Say what you mean. Mean what you say.

## Pick one word per concept
Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, it’s confusing to have `fetch`, `retrieve`, and `get` as equivalent methods of different classes.

## Don’t pun
Avoid using the same word for two purposes. Using the same term for two different ideas is essentially a pun.

## Use solution domain names
Use computer science (CS) terms, algorithm names, pattern names, math terms, and so forth. Choosing technical names for technical things is usually the most appropriate course.

## Use problem domain names
When there is no a suitable name for what you’re doing, use the name from the problem domain. At least the programmer who maintains your code can ask a domain expert what it means.

## Add meaningful context
We need to place names in context for our reader by enclosing them in well-named classes, functions, or namespaces. If we are not able to do that, then prefixing the name may be necessary as a last resort.

## Don’t add gratuitous context
Shorter names are generally better than longer ones, so long as they are clear. Add no more context to a name than is necessary.
