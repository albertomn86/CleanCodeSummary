# Classes

## Class organization
Class should begin with a list of variables. Public static constants should come first. Then private static variables, followed by private instance variables (Java convention).

## Classes should be small!
Smaller is the primary rule designing classes.
The name of a class should describe what responsibilities it fulfills.
We should also be able to write a brief description of the class in about 25 words, without using the words “if,” “and,” “or,” or “but”.

### The Single Responsibility Principle
A class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change. This principle gives us both a definition of responsibility, and a guidelines for class size.

### Cohesion
Classes should have a small number of instance variables. Each of the methods of a class should manipulate one or more of those variables.

### Maintaining cohesion results in many small classes
The act of breaking large functions into smaller functions causes a proliferation of classes.

## Organizing for change
We can introduce interfaces and abstract classes to help isolate the impact of changes.
