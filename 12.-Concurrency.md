# Concurrency

## Concurrency defense principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle.** A given method/class/component should have a single reason to change.

- **Limit the scope of data.** Two threads modifying the same field of a shared object can interfere with each other, causing unexpected behavior. The solution is to protect the critical section in the code that uses the shared object. It is important to restrict the number of such critical sections.

- **Use copies of data.** Avoid sharing the data in the first place. In some situations it is possible to copy objects and treat them as read-only. In other cases it might be possible to copy objects, collect results from multiple threads in these copies and then merge the results in a single thread.

- **Threads should be as independent as possible.** Consider writing your threaded code such that each thread exists in its own world, sharing no data with any other thread.

## Know your library
Things to consider when writing threaded code:

- Use the provided thread-safe collections.
- Use the executor framework for executing unrelated tasks.
- Use nonblocking solutions when possible.
- Several library classes are not thread safe.

## Know your execution models

- **Producer-consumer:** One or more producer threads create some work and place it in a buffer or queue. One or more consumer threads acquire that work from the queue and complete it.

- **Readers-writers:** When you have a shared resource that primarily serves as a source of information for readers, but which is occasionally updated by writers.

- **Dining philosophers:** Applications in which processes compete for shared resources.

## Beware dependencies between synchronized methods
Avoid using more than one method on a shared object.

## Keep synchronized sections small
All sections of code guarded by the same lock are guaranteed to have only one thread executing through them at any given time. So, keep your synchronized sections as small as possible.

## Testing threaded code
- Treat spurious failures as candidate threading issues.
- Get your nonthreaded code working first.
- Make your threaded code pluggable.
- Make your threaded code tunable.
- Run with more threads than processors.
- Run on different platforms.
- Instrument your code to try and force failures.
